{"name":"Junki","tagline":" a.k.a. munki for jamf","body":"junki\r\n=====\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/munkiforjamf/junki\r\n\r\n\r\nJunki somewhat emulates [munki](https://code.google.com/p/munki/) workflows and user experience for JAMF Software's [Casper Suite](http://www.jamfsoftware.com/products/casper-suite/).  \r\n\r\n**Casper** is the best all round management platform for all things Apple. It's incredibly powerful and the JSS has no competition, but the fact it started it's life a few years a go when Mac admins were using image based deployment workflows has meant there is a gap in functionality when it comes to post deployment patching. You can deploy patches via different built in triggers and policies but  there is no built-in GUI for user interaction and the user experience isn't great.\r\n\r\n**Munki** is the absolute best way to deploy and *thin image* Macs. It does one thing, and it does it amazingly well. It can install software and ensure Macs are patched better than any other system. It provides a great GUI, unifies Apple and 3rd party software installs and allows installations to be deferred. . Junki is munki inspired, and *hopefully* brings some of munki's greatness to Casper.\r\n\r\nA lot of people have built different solutions on JAMFnation, but I think junki is the best and most complete way to deploy and patch your Macs \"in the wild\". It provides a great workflow for admins and an excellent user experience.\r\n\r\n### junki isn't just a script... ###\r\n  \r\n...it's a patching and deployment methodology that;  \r\n\r\n* allows munki style deployment groups (*dev / beta / production / etc*)\r\n* will write your Apple Software Update catalogURL dynamically so these deployment groups can be pointed at [NetSUS](https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/viewProduct.html?id=180&view=info) / [reposado](https://github.com/wdas/reposado) branches.\r\n* can chain incremental updaters intelligently (*eg. MS Office 2011 14.3.7, 14.3.8, 14.3.9*)\r\n* leverages existing Casper frameworks and methods (triggers, policies, smart groups) \r\n\r\nFrom a user experience perspective it;   \r\n\r\n* provides Casper with a much needed a GUI for software installation.\r\n* unifies Casper and Apple Software Update installations.\r\n* allows installations to be deferred, allows flexibiliy but maintaining compliance.\r\n* ensures users are logged out during installations.\r\n* integrates nicely with Self Service.\r\n\r\n![User Prompt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/munkiforjamf/junki/master/docs/images/prompt.png)\r\n\r\n### DISCLAIMER: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! ###\r\n\r\n*The documentation is sparse, the code isn't pretty and it shouldn't be written in bash but it works! I am not a professional programmer, but I do think I have nailed the workflows and user experience. It probably should be re-written in Python once I am more comfortable.
